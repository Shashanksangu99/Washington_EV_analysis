# Washington EV Analysis Project 🚗⚡
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) adoption in Washington state using a dataset with key attributes such as vehicle type, electric range, and geographic location. The project involves data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and visualization in Tableau.

## Project Structure 📊

## Data Cleaning 🧹:

Handled missing data and cleaned columns such as electric_range, vehicle_age, and electric_utility.

Performed in Python using Pandas.

## SQL Analysis 🛠️:

Conducted various queries to understand EV adoption patterns, distribution, and market trends.

Key analyses include EV counts by county, electric range per make, and utility provider data for high-range EVs.

## Tableau Visualization 📈:

Created interactive dashboards to visualize trends in EV adoption, geographic distribution, and more.

Key charts include line charts, bar charts, maps, and bubble charts.

## Key Features 🌟

📅 Line Chart: EV adoption over the years with a forecast for 2025.

📊 Horizontal Bar Chart: Top N vehicle manufacturers.

🗺️ Map Chart: County-wise distribution of CAFV-eligible EVs.

🥧 Pie Chart: Breakdown of EV types (BEV and PHEV).

🌳 Tree Map: Electric range distribution across cities.

🔵 Bubble Chart: Top 10 cities by EV count.
